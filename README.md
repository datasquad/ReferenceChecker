This is developmental python code to check references of a bunch of pdf files that are saved in a folder. The use case for which this is written is to check whether the references included in submissions for an assignment can be verified.

There are two versions:

**ref_checker.ipnyb**

This will check all submissions in a folder and return a spreadsheet with one row for all unverified references.

**ref_checker_particular_paper.ipnyb**

This will check all references in one paper and return a json file with verification info for all references in a paper.
